# Hi/Hei/Hoi/Hej ðŸ‘‹

**eevahokka/eevahokka** repo is a quick intro to me, Eeva.

Here's the meat:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m here because: I'm looking to expand my skills in data science
- ðŸ™Œ I'm really into: (exploratory) data analysis, data simulation and visualisation, advanced modeling, machine learning, ConvNets
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: BigQuery, PowerBI, generally more in Python

Hoping to populate this profile with more projects soon :)
